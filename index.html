  <p>Happy Birthday sthandwa sam 🫦❤️ the day I've been waiting for has finally come, my King's special day 🥳! The sunshine of my life, the person who is always putting in effort for the sake of my happiness ❤️. I appreciate you with all my heart King 👑💗!! And I am so excited to celebrate your special day with you 😍💋!! 27 years ago today God blessed us with an amazing being 🫦💋 and today I have the honor of calling him my man! 💋💗 I just wanted to take this opportunity to let you know what is in my heart. I hope you know how much I appreciate everything you do for me and all the time you give to me. 💗 even though I always want more attention lol. It means more than you can possibly imagine. Being with you makes my entire day brighter ❤️. Your smile, your onion eyes 😭, and the way you look at me. I love those things, those tiny insignificant things that make you you. 💗 I don't think I'll stop feeling butterflies whenever I am around you. I don't think I'll ever be able to stop myself from being the happiest human whenever I see you. ❤️ I won't ever stop choosing you, and "liking" you with everything I am 😭😭. I know this is a bad analogy but it's like my soul was a rhythm and yours was a beat. My Rhythm had nothing to follow it was a beautiful mess of jumbled notes, while yours was an unwavering beat strong and loud. Together we're music. A perfect melody. ❤️ My soul can only exist in harmony with yours it seems and I wouldn't want it any other way ❤️. You're the most handsomeeee, loving, funniest and remarkable man I know. There are so many lives I want to live with you Bubu 😍. I know we have fucked up a few times in the past, and that made us have those rough patches, but I am certain that we will always get stronger in the end. 💗 Thank you for sticking by my side, and for always being there for me, I appreciate you King ❤️. Looking forward to growing in love with you, looking forward to truly knowing you and understanding you on a much deeper level than I already do. May the 27th chapter of your life be kind to you and may God bless you with happiness, abundance and infinite blessings sthandwa sam ❤️. I ❤️ YOU MY ONE IN A MILLION HANDSOME VENDA NIGGA!!!</p>
