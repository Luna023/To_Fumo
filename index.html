                <p>IHappy Birthday sthandwa sam🫦❤️the day I've been waiting for has finally come, my King's special day🥳!The sunshine of my life, the person who is always putting in effort for the sake of my happiness❤️. I appreciate you with all my heart King👑💗!!And I am so excited to celebrate your special day with you😍💋!!

                  27 years ago today God blessed us with an amazing being🫦💋and today I have  the honour of calling him my man! 💋💗I just wanted to take this opportunity to let you know what is in my heart.I hope you know how much I appreciate everything you do for me and all the time you give to me.💗even though I always want more attention lol. It means more than you can possibly imagine. Being with you makes my entire day brighter❤️.
                  
                  
                  Your smile, your onion eyes😭, and the way you look at me. I love those things, those tiny insignificant things that make you you.💗 I don't think I'll stop feeling butterflies whenever I am around you.
                  
                  
                  I don't think I'll ever be able to stop myself from being the happiest human whenever i see you. ❤️I won't ever stop choosing you, and "liking" you with everything I am😭😭. I know this is a bad analogy but it's like my soul was a rhythm and yours was a beat. My Rhythm had nothing to follow it was a beautiful mess of jumbled notes, while yours was an unwavering beat strong and loud. Together we're music. A perfect melody. ❤️
                  
                  My soul can only exist in harmony with yours it seems and I wouldn't want it any other way❤️. You're the most handsomeeee, loving, funniest and remarkable man I know. There are so many lives I want to live with you Bubu😍. I know we have fucked up a few times in the past, and that made us have those rough patches, but i am certaim that we will always get stronger in the end.💗
                  Thank you for sticking by my side, and for always being there for me, I appreciate you King❤️. Looking forward to growing in love with you, looking forward to truly knowing you and understanding you on a much deeper level than I already do. May the 27th chapter of your life be kind to you and may God bless you with happiness,abundance and infinite blessings sthandwa sam❤️.  I ❤️ YOU MY ONE IN A MILLION HANDSOME VENDA NIGGA!!!</p>
